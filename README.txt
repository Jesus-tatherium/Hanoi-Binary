Context: i was watching 3Blue1Brown videos and saw the one linked in source. i decided it was a fun mini code to do and did it using what he said about counting in binary:" every time you flip the last bit, move disk 0 one peg to the right, if you are on the right most peg, you just loop it back to the first peg" and then "if you roll over to the X place in binary, move the (X - 1)peg"
